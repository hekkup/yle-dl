This is a plugin for librtmp for downloading media files from the
video streaming services of the Finnish national broadcasting company
Yle: Yle Areena (http://areena.yle.fi, http://ylex.yle.fi/ylex-areena)
and Elävä Arkisto (http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/).

Installation
------------

0. If this is a tar.gz package, goto to step 1. If this is the git
version of the source code, download a modified version of rtmpdump
from https://github.com/aajanki/rtmpdump/tree/plugin2 and unpack it
into a subdirectory called rtmpdump.

1. Install prerequisites: libssl, libcrypto, pthreads, libltdl, python
and pycrypto. Additionally in OS X libiconv and Xcode, and in MinGW
libiconv.

On Debian/Ubuntu installing packages libssl-dev, libltdl-dev,
python-dev and python-pycrypto satisfies the dependencies.

2. Compile and install:

make
make install

To avoid conflict with system's librtmp package the recommended way is
to link librtmp statically with the following commands:

make LIB_RTMP="librtmp/librtmp.a -lltdl -rdynamic"
make install

On MacOS, append SYS=darwin:

make SYS=darwin
make install SYS=darwin

On MinGW:llä (Windows), append SYS=mingw:

make SYS=mingw
make install SYS=mingw
